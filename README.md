~ A simple slots game programmed with C ~

Description: This is a simple personal project built in C programming language. Everything is
completely hard coded. The quality of this code is definetely not the best as it was my first
original programming atempt besides my university homework. The "slot machine" is entirely
made with ASCII art in the console. Also the program does not use any pointers at all.

- To try the game simply run the slots.c file and follow the instructions given in the console.
- Winning, although rare, is possible !
- Remember, you must be an adult to play ðŸŽ°ðŸ”ž
